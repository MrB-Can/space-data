# Space Data
This is a tool to generate space data from multiple sources. This is part of paulspipes, a data generation system for demo and testing data for different data and database types. 
## Modules
There are seeral modules for creating data for testing. 
### NORAD Objects
Up to date information on all NORAD tracked objets since the first object sent to space. This system relies on NORAD identifiers which I've made publically available here. 
#### Purpose
This is intended to be run by CLI or serverless function and insert objects into a single table in a database for us in analytics, demonstrations, or testing. 
#### Functions
